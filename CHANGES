# 19.08

   -- mini-Castro has been substantially updated to look and feel more like
      a mini-app. Inputs files are no longer required, and all configuration
      is set at the command line (the only necessary selection is the number
      of zones per dimension in the simulation). Running the mini-app with
      no command line arguments prints information about how to run it.
      stdout generated during the run has been substantially simplified,
      with a simple diagnostic about the state of the code printed every
      50 timesteps (this frequency is adjustable). Additionally, AMReX has
      been made a git submodule of the code, so it is easy to check out the
      code and its dependency in a single step.

   -- mini-Castro has been relicensed with an MIT license.
